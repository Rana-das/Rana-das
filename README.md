# Hello! 👋

Greetings! I’m Rana Das, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science graduate with a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in Computer Science (majoring in Data Science) from Daffodil International University (DIU). My expertise lies in information science, data science, and data analysis, and I’m constantly seeking to harness the power of data to solve real-world challenges.

My current research is centered around the intersection of NLP and Machine Learning, with a focus on how these technologies can enhance automated systems and improve human-computer interactions. In parallel, I am working on a journal paper that explores novel applications in data science, particularly in NLP and ML. I am always eager to collaborate with others in these areas to push the boundaries of what data and AI can achieve.

## Look me up! 🕵️
